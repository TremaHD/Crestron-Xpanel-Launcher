# Crestron Xpanel Launcher
A small Windows utility that allow you to launch up to 8 vtz or c3p files.
At the first launch of the application, the folder where the Crestron Xpanel application is located ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Crestron\XPanel"), 
will be duplicated 8 times in the startup folder. The file "application.xml" in each \META-INF\AIR subfolder will be modified accordingly.
You can specify the IP Address, Room ID and IP ID before launching. A short name can also be specified which will appear in the window top bar.
When you leave the application, the settings are automatically saved to a file.
The little "X" in the upper left corner of each line, delete the content of that line.
